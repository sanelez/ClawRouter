// src/utils/polymarket/relayer.ts
//
// Thin wrapper over @polymarket/builder-relayer-client for the deposit-wallet
// lifecycle: derive (CREATE2, pre-deploy), deploy (WALLET-CREATE), and signed
// WALLET batches (approvals, redeem). Everything here is GASLESS — the relayer
// sponsors gas. It is a courier, not a custodian: it only ever receives
// EIP-712 payloads signed by the local key, which it can neither alter (the
// signature covers every byte) nor replay (nonce + deadline).
//
// The relayer requires API credentials (polymarket.com → Settings → API Keys)
// purely to authenticate use of its gas-sponsoring service. Phase 2 moves
// these behind the BlockRun gateway so end users need no Polymarket account.
